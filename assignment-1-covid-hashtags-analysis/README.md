# Assignment 1
## Initial organization of work and projects & Python skills exercises

### Scope: knowledge and skils
* Docker
* Jupiter IPython Notebooks (or Jupiter Lab)
* Python:  
    * data organization: Pandas, GeoPandas
    * visualization: Bokeh, Plotly, Folium
* Teamwork

### Tasks

1. (1 point) _Team formation_ 

Estiblish project team, preferably of ~3 people. Make possible alignment with a leading project you are working on (aka. Danologia project).   

#### *Expected outcome:* 
A list of collaborators delivered to your teaching assistant, points are awarded individually to all team members

2. (3 points) _Initial project proposal_

#### *Expected outcome:*
Description of project idea to be presented briefly on the next session

3. (3 points) _Visualization of twitter hashtags popularity_

Visualize on a interactive countries map, how popular were some of COVID-related hashtags through time and space.

#### *Data:* 
Use datasets from [this site](http://twitterdata.covid19dataresources.org/download). Datasets are stored by days, choose a few for a visualisation - it's not necessary to use all of them. In _example_data_ there are some files archived in case of provided website crash

#### *Expected outcome:* 
An interactive map, presenting usage of hashtags. 

With this analysis I'd like to answer a following questions:
* What is a distribution of COVID-related hashtags over countries?
* Which countries prefered which hashtags?
* How it was changing over time?
